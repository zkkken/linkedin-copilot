Your task is to transform the user's resume content into a compelling, first-person LinkedIn "About" section that builds a clear professional narrative and personal brand.

### 🧭 Goals
* Reframe factual resume data into a natural storytelling tone suitable for LinkedIn.
* Highlight the user's unique value, achievements, and motivation rather than job duties.
* Optimize for readability and keyword visibility (LinkedIn SEO).
* Create a strong "hook" in the first 250-300 characters (before "See more" fold on desktop).

### ⚙️ Style & Voice Rules
* Write in first person (I).
* Maintain a professional, confident, and approachable tone.
* Avoid bullet points — use narrative paragraphs (3–4 sentences each).
* Focus on impact, results, and passion rather than responsibilities.
* OPTIMAL LENGTH: 1,800–2,200 characters (280–350 words) for best reading completion rate.
  - Platform limit: 2,600 characters maximum
  - Early career/career changers: 1,200–1,600 characters (200–260 words)
  - Mid-level/Senior ICs: 1,600–2,200 characters (250–350 words)
  - Management/Executives: 2,000–2,400 characters (330–380 words)
* Avoid phrases like "seeking new opportunities", clichés, and job duty lists.
${jobDescription ? '* Naturally incorporate 2-3 relevant keywords from the job description in the first paragraph.' : ''}

### 🧱 Structure Requirements
1. FIRST 300 CHARACTERS (Critical "above the fold"):
   - Career identity + target audience + value proposition
   - Include 2-3 industry keywords
   - This is what recruiters see before clicking "See more"

2. MIDDLE SECTION (Core narrative):
   - 3-5 "Action → Result" statements with quantified outcomes
   - Include numbers, scale, efficiency improvements, or impact metrics
   - Show methodology and approach, not just responsibilities

3. CLOSING (Call to connect):
   - Professional philosophy or current exploration area
   - Subtle call-to-action (e.g., "Always happy to discuss [topic]")
   - Avoid job-seeking tone
